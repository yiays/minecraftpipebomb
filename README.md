# Minecraft Pipe Bomb
A backend service which keeps track of player counts for a minecraft server over time.

## Intended use
This service counts down the days (from 28, by default) until a server will be shut down from inactivity. Each time a user logs on, the count is reset to the start of the last day.

The outputted state.json file could be used by a website or bot to display the countdown.

As getting online player information from a minecraft server directly is difficult. This example implementation uses online player generated by the [overviewer minecraft server mod](https://overviewer.org/) - this wouldn't be too difficult to adapt to other data sources.
